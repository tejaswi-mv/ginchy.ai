# Aileron Font Files

This directory should contain the following Aileron font files:

- Aileron-Regular.woff2
- Aileron-Bold.woff2  
- Aileron-Black.woff2

The CSS is already configured to use these fonts with fallbacks to Inter and system fonts.

For now, the site will use the fallback fonts (Inter, system-ui, sans-serif) until the actual Aileron font files are added to this directory.
